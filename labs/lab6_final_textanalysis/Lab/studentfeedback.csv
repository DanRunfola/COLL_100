1,"This is an incredible class where you learn data analysis skills and then apply to real world scenarios.  Everything learned in this class is applicable to other aspects of school and life in general.  There is no extra work besides the labs and the professors as well as the teacher assistants are extremely helpful, always willing yo answer quesitons. Overall, the best COLL 100 to take.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
2,"Coding is hard at first, but Dan and the TA's set up clear and concise directions.  While the creative sectionsa re hard, if you try your best and turn in all the deliverables then you will still do well.  The lectures are fun, so go! IN the end, the class does get better!",F,An appropriate difficulty level
3,Breaking Intuition is a fun way of interpreting Data Analysis.  You do have to be willing to code on a computer but it comes with easy to follow step-by-step instructions. It's a worthwhile COLL to take if you want to look at the world around you in a different light.,M,An appropriate difficulty level
4,This course is a combination of computer programming and the study of data.  The lectures are very interesting and give you a peek into how data affects our modern day world. Be prepared to step outside of your comfort zone with labs and be challenged when it comes to your tech-savvy knowledge.,F,An appropriate difficulty level
5,"The class is largely in the end a blend of computer science and logic being used to complete labs.  So far I don't really see the course as having many takeaways.  That is, the labs might portray certain ideas, but they are jumbled in an array of (unnecessary) handholding.  I believe it is essentially a confused philosophy course, as a person like me will not use R again.",M,An appropriate difficulty level
6,This class is very interesting and it will probably be useful for future classes/jobs.  If you are into coding / programming then take this class for sure.  If you want to learn more about using data then you should think about taking this class.  There are 2 lab work days per week and 1 lecture day. Dan's lectures are great and the labs can be a little bit challenging (for me at least because I'm not so good iwth coding) but definitely manageable.,M,An appropriate difficulty level
7,"I ahd a lot of fun playing with Data! The labs however, can sometimes become very hard and lose driection as errors appear.  Most of us are not equipped to address the errors.  However, I have had a lot of fun learning how to manipulate and use data.  The labs, however challenging, cause me to think deeply about the data.",M,An appropriate difficulty level
8,I think that Breaking Intuition is an extremely interesting course with cool professors so I highly recommend that you take it.,M,An appropriate difficulty level
9,"It's a really great course to take because the lectures (by Dan) are incredibly interesting and challenge you in ways that I was not used to.  The labs are great, challenging but always doable.  Dan really makes it about the learninga nd not about the grades, which gives the true sense of learning for yourself.  Take this class!",F,An appropriate difficulty level
10,"Breaking intuition is by far the best COLL 100 there is.  It is taught by the best teacher and the TAs are super helpful.  The course load is not too intensive and is extremely interesting, so if you do the work you will get a good grade.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
11,"Breaking Intuition is a class that involves using data to explore aspects of the world and to find solutions to certain questions.  The course involves the use of critical thinking skills and creativity. In my opinion this is not a hard class, but it is not an easy one either.  As long as a person puts in the effort in their work, they should do well.  However, there may be some issues involving coding.  Always ask for help!",M,An appropriate difficulty level
12,"Breaking Intuition is a moderately difficult class that requires coding and data analysis.  The course is intriguing and the lectures introduce the labs apply to our lives.  I would recommend teh course to someone somewhat comfortable with coding, with an interest in Big Data.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
13,"There are no midterms, one final paper, one lab every two weeks, and lectures by someone from a specific subject field every Friday.  You learn some simple programming which has proved to be very interesting.  The professors and TA are incredibly helpful and they seem to really care that you understand the material rather than just being able to go through the motions.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
14,"I have learned things that I personally wouldn't have thought of in a college classroom.  The class does not require prior skills, but they would be helpful.  The class consists of doing all computer labs.  I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
15,Breaking intuition is an interesting class where students work with a programming language and other tools to change data to appear as easily accessed informaiton.  Don't let programming scare you!  The labs are easy to follow.  It's a great course!,M,An appropriate difficulty level
16,It's a lot of coding and I came into it not thinking there'd be any.  So that threw me off.  I think my grade should be higher but that's just me.  Very interesting and life changing class though!,M,Too hard
17,"First you freak out because you learn there's programming.  Then you calm down because you think you have the programming things under control and you think the class is interesting.  Then you freak out again, because you realize you have no idea what you're doing... but somehow ist ends up alright.  Overall, you have a funt ime.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
18,"It's not international relations like you think!  However, it is a great class!  The lectures are captivating and you will learn to code using Rstudio.  Don't be worried, the coding isn't that hard.",M,An appropriate difficulty level
19,"This is a great interdisciplinary course.  If you hate computers this class maybe ins't for you, but every step of hte labs is clearly explained.  Dan is a great professor and he's an awesome lecturer.",F,An appropriate difficulty level
20,"I didn't intend on taking Breaking Intuition, however the class has probably taught me more than any other class here at William and Mary.  If Big Data and data analysis is for you, this class is for you.",M,An appropriate difficulty level
21,"I went into Breaking Intuition having no clue what it was about.  I thook this class on a whim but I am very very glad I did.  This class provides valuable insight into the processes of data collection and analysis, and gives you a new perspective on the media and research, and on how much I really know.  I highly recommend this course.",M,An appropriate difficulty level
22,A great introductory course that provides interesting material about data science,M,An appropriate difficulty level
23,"Breaking intuition is a fun class to take, as both the lectures and labs are very interesting and although some of the coding is confusing at first it isn't that difficult to get the hang of it.",M,An appropriate difficulty level
24,Like the explortaion into Computer Science.  Not a reading heavy course.  Relevant to a whole bunch of interests and majors.  Bi-weekly homework that cna be done mostly in class.  Great teacher support if necessary.  Multiple office hours for outside help.,F,An appropriate difficulty level
25,Breaking Intuition is a challenging course that will cahgne the way you think about the world and you'll learn to do things you never thought you were capable of.,F,An appropriate difficulty level
26,Breaking Intuition is a good class if you have a wide variety of interests.  It involves a little bit of coding but it is very manageable.  The topics we cover are very interesting and the lectures are very engaging.,F,An appropriate difficulty level
27,I love this class.  The labs are interesting and fun while the lectures are a blast.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a COLL 100.,M,An appropriate difficulty level
28,I have a coding background so the labs geared toward us learning coding are rather simple.  I wish I could know more on how we as infidivuals and firms play with our intuition and hat we can do (as hyumans) to break what they are doing to us.,F,Too easy
29,A computer programming and data computing course.  Consists of two class periods working on and in computer labs and one lecture per week.  The class challenges your initial thought processes and attempts to break your intuition.,F,Too easy
30,"The labs start off fairly simple, but get a lot more complicated starting about halfway through.  Dan's lectures are pretty interesting, guest lectures are supposed to get better next semester.",F,Too hard
