\textbf {\large \\ Course Description:} The human species has nearly always sought to predict the future – from reading the clouds and sacrificial rites, to statistics and big data parsing. At the core of this history lies human intuition, and the interplay between belief, story, and knowledge. In this class, students will learn the fundamental ways in which the human species has used data over time – from arcane interpretation to artificial intelligence – and closely inspect modern day assumptions about intuition and meaning. As a part of this course, students will learn how to parse and visualize large datasets to extract meaning, and use those findings to argue for or against solutions to real-world problems. \\

\textbf {\large Course Objectives:} 
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep-0.4em
  \item Challenge students traditional assumptions about the production of knowledge.
  \item Provide a more critical understanding of scientific literature.
  \item Develop your data communication, analysis, and visualization skills for future courses (and jobs).
  \item Develop critical thinking skills necessary to become more responsible for your own learning and better engage with broadly defined challenges.
  \item Provide an opportunity to fulfill the COLL 100 requirement (passing grade required).

% Course Policies. These are just examples, modify to your liking.
\textbf {\large Time Commitment:} Excelling in college level course work typically requires on average three to four hours per credit per week.  Since this is a four credit course, in addition to the time we meet as a class each week, you should expect to spend nine to twelve hours on average reading, writing, or otherwise preparing for this class on a weekly basis.\\

\textbf {\large Attendance:} This class does not have an attendance policy.  However, it will be difficult to learn enough to pass the class without regular participation, as the majority of course content relevant to tests and assignments will be covered in class.  Unannounced opportunities for extra credit will periodically be given in-class.\\

\textbf {\large Discussions:} Most lecture sessions will begin with a brief discussion of the assigned materials.  As such, each week students will be asked to come to class prepared with two to three bullet points for discussion - these can represent questions the material raised, commentary, or critiques.  These discussion points may be collected for extra credit.\\

\textbf {\large Classroom Behavior:} Please remain civil during discussions to promote the open exchange of ideas and foster a culture of open dialogue.  Please bear in mind that all students are entitled to their own opinion.  You are expected to listen attentively to each person speaking.  Please refrain from eating during class (and, if you must, make sure it isn't loud!).\\

\textbf {\large Teacher-student conferences:} Students performing at a C level or below are required to schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss class performance.\\

\textbf {\large Late / Poor Performance Policy:} Assignments will not be accepted late, excepting in documented circumstances (i.e., an illness with a doctor's note).  \textit{Recognizing that it is entirely possible to underperform on key days, your lowest lab assignment grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.}\\

\textbf{Academic dishonesty is taken very seriously.  Make sure to cite all of your work, and do not turn in work that is not yours!  Cases of academic dishonesty will be evaluated and acted upon in accordance with William and Mary policies, which can be found at http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/
